                Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (Superfund / CERCLA)</a>
                funded the cleanup of hazardous waste and gave the EPA
                the ability to hold the people who produced the waste responsible.

                regulates the amount of pollution that is allowed into waterways and made illegal the dumping of
                pollution into water without permits. It also funded the contruction of water and sewage treatment
                plants.

                <h3>Limit the amount of Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere!</h3>
                There are laws about air pollution, but not greenhouse gases! Hold car companies responsible
                for the carbon dioxide they produce.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>A Carbon Tax?</h3>
                Tax people for the amount of greenhouse gases they produce, creating an incentive to
                go green.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Funding for renewable energy</h3>
                Make it easier for companies and people to switch away from greenhouse gas-producing
                energy sources.
